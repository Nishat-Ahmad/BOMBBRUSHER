# BombBrusher™
A simple Minesweeper game implemented in C++ using SFML graphics library.


## Project status
_*Ded.*_


## Installation
- SFML library installed on your system.
- Font file "minecraft_font.ttf" to be placed in the appropriate directory.
- Images folder containing all the images used in the game.
- Use the releases to find the dependencies for the project.
- Remember to download Required file and extract it. Also "install" the minecraft_font.tff to make it work properly.
  Also remember to add the images to the repo folder.


## How to Play
Use the mouse to interact with the game just like minesweeper. _There is no back feature ingame so you have to close it and than run it again._

1. Click on the "Play" button to start the game.
2. Choose the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
3. Left-click to reveal a tile. The number on the tile represents the number of mines adjacent to it.
4. Right-click to place a flag on a suspected mine.
5. The game ends when all non-mine tiles are revealed or when a mine is clicked.


## Dependencies
- C++ standard libraries: `<iostream>`, `<functional>`, `<Windows.h>`, `<fstream>`, `<algorithm>`
- SFML libraries: `<SFML/Graphics.hpp>`


## Features
i. Three difficulty levels: Easy (10x10 grid), Medium (15x15 grid), Hard (20x20 grid).

ii. Pause functionality during gameplay by pressing p.

iii. Game also restarts by pressing p.


## Code Summary
### 1. `main.cpp`
   
  Overview:
  
  This file serves as the main entry point for the "BOMBBRUSHER" game.The primary responsibilities of this file include initializing the game
  window, handling user interactions, and managing the different game states and screens.
    
    Main Window Initialization:
    Creates and configures the main window using SFML.
   
    Game Loop Management:
    Implements a loop that keeps the main window active and responsive to user inputs.
   
    Pause Function:
    Contains a Pause function that displays a pause screen and waits for the user to unpause the game 
    by pressing 'P'.
   
    Difficulty Selection and Game Modes:
    Provides lambda functions to handle the opening of different game mode windows (easy, medium, hard) 
    and the high score window. Each difficulty level opens a new window with a corresponding 
    game configuration.
   
    High Score Window:
    Implements a high score window that displays buttons for different difficulties and a back
    button to return to the main window.
   
    Difficulty Selection Window:
    Opens a window where users can select the game's difficulty level.
    Each difficulty button initiates a new game with the specified difficulty.
   
    Button Handling:
    Utilizes ScreenButton objects to manage button creation, click handling, and hover effects.
    Buttons include "Play", "High Score", and difficulty-specific buttons ("Easy", "Medium", "Hard").
   
    TextBox Integration:
    Uses TextBox objects to display text on the main window and difficulty selection window.
